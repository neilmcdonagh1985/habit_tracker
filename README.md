# habit_tracker_group_project

Used: JavaScript, MongoDB, Vue, html(with erb), CSS.

This was the second of the projects on the CodeClan course, directly following the JavaScript module. I was in a team of 5 developers for this project. The main goals were to gain experience working in a team, consolidate learning of JavaScript, gain experience using Agile working methods, become more confident using Git and Github and investigate some JavaScript libraries which would be new for me.

From a personal point of view, most of these aims were achieved, albeit to varying extents. These aims were achieved to varying extents. The Agile concepts which were put into practice by my team were: the use of a kanban board, daily stand-up, sprints (in a miniture format as the project was 5 days long).

This project covered a far wider-range than the first one on the course in the following ways: It was full-stack (we had to course our own data but also use Vue for the front-end), there was a focus User Experience (we documented user journeys, user needs, proto personas etc.).

My team and I chose to develop an app for calorie-tracking. Not necessarily an app for people who wish to reduce their calorie intake (though it could be used for that purpose), rather to simply monitor their daily (or weekly, or monthly) eating habits. We wanted the app to have the versatility
to help users of different needs e.g. losing weight, gaining weight, keeping track of their calories for personal interest. From the offset, we wanted our app to have a visual display of calorie intake that was easy for the user to see and interpret at a glance.

The integration of libraries which provided the radial bars and graphs in the app was a new challenge, and Vue was the first time I had used a front-end technology. 

Things to Improve:

Bring in an API for users to select their food so they would not have to manually insert the amount of calories per meal.

Provide a 'fun facts' function which when daily meals are entered, facts are displayed about recommended daily intake in relation to the user's personal stats.
